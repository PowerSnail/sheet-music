## Preface

It is a well known fact that, after the violin is taken out of the case for the first time every day, the first two hours or more are wasted in **regaining that feeling of ease, fluency and surety which the violinist experiences at the end of his daily practice**.

How much time could be saved; how much energy could be spared; and how much more profitable would the daily practice be if that feeling of ease, fluency and surety could be had **at the beginning** of the day's work instead of at the end, by practising specific exercises for a few minutes composed according to scientific rules based on psycho-physiological laws. The scales, the etudes and the compositions to be learned would not present any more "ugly or rough" spots, as the fingers and the bow would be much more responsive and ready to obey the impulses of the player's mind.

This is what the followig exercises intend to do: **to get the player into form in a very short space of time and keep him fit for the day's work**. These exercises are composed according to the same scientific principles on which is based my method: "_The Artist's Technic of Violin Playing_". They are especially composed to train the fingers and the bow as quickly and as thoroughly as possible. In fact, the twelve exercises contained in this book form a most excellent technical breviary that may be used with unfailing and immediate results whenever the violinist wishes "**to get into form in the shortest possible time**".

The author would cnsider himself amply rewarded for his labors if the following exercises conscientiously practised, would help to minimize the dreaded weariness of the first hours of daily practice.

## Explanation of the signs

The sign (---) indicates the sliding of the fingers.

I: First or E string.

IV: Fourth or G string

\lilysymbol{scripts.downbow}: Down-bow

\lilysymbol{scripts.upbow}: Up-bow

## Five General Rules to be Strictly Adhered to

1. Cultivate at all times a feeling of absolute comfort while practising
2. In practising finger-exercises watch your bow; in practising bow-exercises observe a good position of the left hand.
3. Accent the weaker notes; make every note sund with a clear, full and round tone. 
4. Remember always that in technic evenness is that which counts most.
5. Form the habit of listening to your playing with the utmost attention; sharpen your hearing s as to detect the slightest disturbance in the flow of tone.

## Five Left hand Rules to be Strictly Adhered to

1. Keep the elbow well under the violin and the fingertips parallel to the strings.
2. Try to forget the existence of the thumb; never pess it against the neck of the violin.
3. Do not strike the fingers upon the strings with too much force it is wasting one's physical energy. Cultivate a very sudden and elastic spring-like finger action and keep every preceding finger on the string.
4. In shifting, pay due attention to the guiding finger which is the finger stopping the last note before shifting.
5. In a downward shift, remember that the thumb acts as a forerunner to the other fingers.

## Five Bow Rules to be Strictly Adhered to

1. At all times cultivate freedom of movement.
2. Bear in mind that the elasticity and flexibility of all joints of the arm and the fingers are as important as those of the wrist.
3. Have and retain always a balanced hold of the bow; try to feel every stroke with your fingertips.
4. Accent the up bow to equalize it with the down bow.
5. Never forget to round off the crossing of strings and the change of bow.

## FIRST EXERCISE

There are two fundamental "settings" of the left hand fingers which we will name the "easy" and the "difficult".

The "easy setting" is when the first finger stops a note on a lower string while the others are placed on higher strings (@fig:figure1).

The "difficult setting" is exactly the opposite; first finger on a higher string, other fingers on lower strings (Fig. II). 

Chords of three and four notes use both "settings", alternately or simultaneously.

DIRECTIONS FOR PRACTISING: Repeat each bar four times. The whole notes should be held firmly. In a) one finger only is moving. In b) and c) two fingers are moving alternately i.e. while the one ascends the other descends and vice versa. In d) and f) two fingers are moving simultaneously. In e) and g) four fingers are moving alternately; two against two. Practise every day the bars contained in one letter only from both \circled{A} and \circled{B} following immediately with \circled{C} which is the practical application of \circled{A} and \circled{B}.
